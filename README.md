# Out-of-Order Generalization of Min/Max Operations
## Description
The project aims to train generalized models that work on out-of-order datasets.
The task is simple: pick the largest/smallest number from a list of numbers. 
Let's say the sentence is as follows:

The maximum value amongst 1, 2, and 3 is ____.

The model must be able to fill in the value, regardless of whether it has been trained on a similar problem.

### Current features
- Dataset generation
  - Random data
  - All combinations
  - Exporting dataset as an HDF5 file
  - Loading an HDF5 file
- A single sentence and mask with support for flexible addition 

## Installation
Create a new Anaconda environment from `environment.yml`. 

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Usage
To generate a dataset, execute the following command:
```bash
python main.py generate_dataset [random | all] [OPTIONS] 
```

For a random dataset, you must also pass the sample count.
```bash
python main.py generate_dataset random COUNT [OPTIONS]
```
